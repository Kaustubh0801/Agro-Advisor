# Description:
This project implements a machine learning model in Python that recommends the best crop to grow and fertilizer to be used based on soil composition, pH level, rainfall, temperature, and humidity. It utilizes the Random Forest Classifier algorithm for prediction. The model has been successfully deployed and integrated into an intuitive and interactive user interface using Streamlit. This allows users to input their specific data and receive instant crop and fertilizer recommendations.
